# Vision-Aided Beam Selection using Edge AI

---

## 1. Problem Statement, Motivation & Objectives

Modern wireless communication systems (5G/mmWave) rely on **beamforming** to direct signals toward users. However, selecting the optimal beam traditionally requires **beam sweeping**, where all beams are tested sequentially, leading to high latency and inefficiency.

### Motivation
*   **Significant Delay:** Beam sweeping introduces substantial overhead[cite: 1].
*   **Dynamic Environments:** Traditional methods struggle with moving users[cite: 1].
*   **Latency Needs:** Real-time, low-latency solutions are required for mobile scenarios[cite: 1].
*   **Edge AI:** Enables on-device decision-making without cloud dependency, reducing round-trip time.

### Objectives
*   Develop a **vision-based system** to estimate 3D user position (Azimuth $\theta$ and Distance $d$).
*   Utilize **AI models (YOLOv8 + LightDepthNet)** for high-precision detection and depth estimation.
*   Predict **optimal beam direction** without exhaustive search.
*   Enable **real-time inference** on edge devices like the Raspberry Pi.
*   Improve **efficiency and responsiveness** of beam selection.

## 2. Proposed Solution (Overview)

This project proposes a **vision-assisted beam selection system** using Edge AI to replace traditional RF-only methods.

**The Pipeline:**
`Image → YOLO Detection → Depth Estimation → Position Estimation → Beam Selection`

*   **YOLOv8m** detects the user's mobile device location.
*   **LightDepthNet** estimates the depth of the scene.
*   Combined output provides the **3D position (angle + distance)**.
*   Position is mapped directly to a **Beam Index** in the codebook.

## 3. Hardware & Software Setup

### Hardware
*   **Raspberry Pi 5:** Primary edge device.
*   **Raspberry Pi Camera:** Image acquisition.
*   **MacBook Pro M3 Pro:** Local development and hardware-accelerated testing (MPS).
*   **Hailo-8 NPU:** Target for high-speed edge inference (26 TOPS).

### Software
*   **Python 3.10** with legacy-compatible dependencies (NumPy 1.26.4).
*   **PyTorch / Ultralytics (YOLOv8)**.
*   **LightDepthNet:** Custom-trained depth model[cite: 1].
*   **OpenCV:** For real-time preprocessing and visualization.

### Preprocessing
*   **Image Resizing:** All inputs scaled to **416×416** to ensure Hailo NPU compatibility.

## 5. Model Design, Training & Evaluation

### A. YOLOv8 (Object Detection)
*   **Model:** YOLOv8m (Medium).
*   **Training:** 50 epochs at 416×416 resolution.
*   **Performance:**
    *   **mAP50:** 0.982 – 0.987.
    *   **Box Loss:** 0.34 – 0.38.

### B. LightDepthNet (Depth Estimation)
The **LightDepthNet** is a lightweight **Encoder-Decoder** architecture designed for edge efficiency[cite: 1].
*   **Encoder:** Extracts hierarchical feature maps from resolutions $7\times7$ to $112\times112$[cite: 1].
*   **Decoder:** Progressive reconstruction using **Residual Merging Upsampling (RMU)** modules[cite: 1].
*   **Key Blocks:** Includes **Adaptive Convolution blocks (PConvk)** with RepPad and PReLU, and **Upsampling Convolution blocks (NearConv51)**[cite: 1].
*   **Metrics:** Achieved an **RMSE of 0.704** and **$\delta_1$ of 0.693**[cite: 1].

## 6. Model Compression & Efficiency Metrics
*   **Lightweight Architecture:** RMU units allow the decoder to maintain detail without high parameter counts[cite: 1].
*   **Inference Speed:** Significantly faster than heavy models like MiDaS while maintaining sufficient accuracy for beamforming priors.

## 7. Model Deployment & On-Device Performance
*   **Export:** Models converted to **ONNX** natively at 416x416 to prevent dimension mismatch in skip connections.
*   **Optimization:** Optimized for Apple Silicon (MPS) and target Hailo-8 NPU.
*   **Performance:** Real-time inference achieved locally on M3 Pro and target Pi 5 environment.
