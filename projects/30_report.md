## 1. Problem Statement, Motivation & Objectives

India records over 4.6 lakh road crashes per year, killing 1.7 lakh people annually.
Rear-end collisions are among the top contributors — at 40 km/h a distracted driver covers 20 metres before reacting.
Modern Forward Collision Warning (FCW) systems exist in premium cars but are completely absent from the vehicles that need them most: two-wheelers, autorickshaws, school buses, and older cars — over 90% of Indian road traffic.
All major public ADAS datasets (KITTI, BDD-100K, Waymo Open) are from Western roads and are blind to Indian-specific objects: autorickshaw recall is 0%, bicycle recall is 2.7%, and zebra crossing recall is 0% when using any off-the-shelf COCO-pretrained model on Indian footage.

**Why Edge AI is mandatory for ADAS:**
Cloud round-trip latency from Bengaluru to a public broker is ~280 ms (measured live via ThingsBoard MQTT), while the airbag deployment deadline is 30 ms and the AEB deadline is 100 ms.
Cloud-only ADAS physically cannot meet these safety budgets.
India's DPDP Act 2023 also restricts streaming raw cabin/road video off the device.
This system is **vehicle-agnostic**: the same ₹12,000 hardware deploys on a bicycle, autorickshaw, bus, or truck — a miniaturised version of the edge AI architecture used in Tesla FSD (INT8 on AI4 SoC) and Waymo (multi-sensor, fully on-vehicle inference).

**Key Objectives:**

- Build a real-time forward collision warning system on Raspberry Pi 5 with zero cloud dependency
- Demonstrate 52× model compression via Knowledge Distillation + INT8 quantisation with less than 6% accuracy loss
- Fine-tune YOLOv8n on IIT Hyderabad DriveIndia dataset to recover Indian-specific classes from 0% COCO recall
- Deploy a 3-model INT8 ensemble (COCO + DriveIndia + Pothole) at real-time speed on CPU-only hardware
- Empirically prove edge-AI latency advantage over cloud using live ThingsBoard MQTT round-trip measurement

---

## 2. Proposed Solution (Overview)

Three INT8-quantised YOLOv8n models run in series on every camera frame.
Detections are merged via class-wise NMS, combined with HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance and closing-speed to compute Time-To-Collision (TTC), and fused into a SAFE / WARN / BRAKE decision that drives GPIO LEDs and a buzzer.
Telemetry is pushed to ThingsBoard over MQTT for IoT monitoring and live edge-vs-cloud latency proof.

**System Pipeline:**

```
Pi Camera Module 3  (640×640 frame)
         │
         ├──► COCO YOLOv8n INT8       (3.2 MB,  55 ms)  →  car, person, bus, truck, bicycle
         ├──► DriveIndia YOLOv8n INT8 (3.1 MB,  49 ms)  →  autorickshaw, ambulance, zebra, police
         └──► Pothole YOLOv8n INT8    (10.9 MB, 122 ms)  →  road potholes
                       │
              Union + class-wise NMS
                       │
              HC-SR04 ultrasonic → distance_cm + closing rate → TTC
                       │
              Fusion: SAFE / WARN / BRAKE
                       │
         ┌─────────────┴──────────────┐
         ▼                            ▼
  GPIO LEDs + Buzzer          ThingsBoard MQTT
  Red=BRAKE  Yellow=WARN      latency · decision · classes
  Green=SAFE                  FP32 131ms vs INT8 55ms (live)
```

**Total pipeline: 227 ms · 1.8 FPS** (live measured, 3-model ensemble, Pi 5 CPU, no NPU)

## 4. Data Collection & Dataset Preparation

| Dataset | Source | Samples | Classes | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CIFAR-10 | Krizhevsky 2009, public | 60,000 (32×32) | 10 → binary | Compression study baseline |
| COCO 2017 | cocodataset.org, CC BY 4.0 | 118K train | 80 | YOLOv8n pretrain weights |
| DriveIndia / TiAND | IIT Hyderabad TiHAN (EULA approved) | 66,986 images | 24 | Indian-road fine-tuning |
| Pothole dataset | HuggingFace peterhdd + team labelling | ~2,000 images | 1 | Dedicated pothole head |

### CIFAR-10 Preparation

Binary split: **vehicle** (car, truck, ship, plane) vs **non-vehicle** (bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse).
Input upsampled from 32×32 to 96×96 for MobileNetV2.

### DriveIndia Balanced Subset — `subset_driveindia.py`

The full dataset is severely long-tailed — autorickshaw appears in less than 2% of frames.
A random 5,000-image sample yields only ~50 autorickshaws.
Our sampler picks every rare-class image and proportionally samples head classes, guaranteeing ≥200 examples per class.
Split: 4,000 train / 1,000 val, packaged with 28-class `data.yaml` via `prep_kaggle.py`.

### Pothole Dataset

~2,000 images with bounding-box annotations labelled.
Fine-tuning conducted starting from the peterhdd HuggingFace checkpoint.

## 6. Model Compression & Efficiency Metrics

### MobileNetV2 — 8-Variant Compression Study

| Variant | Size (KB) | Accuracy | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| FP32 baseline | 2,846 | 97.71% | Reference |
| FP16 weights | 1,453 | 97.71% | Lossless 2× |
| INT8 dynamic | 888 | 97.08% | 3.2× smaller |
| INT8 PTQ full | 989 | 84.38% | **PTQ fails on small models — 14% drop** |
| K-means clustering | ~1,200 | 96.8% | Moderate gain |
| Structured pruning 50% | ~2,200 | 96.1% | +15% latency benefit |
| KD Student FP32 | 212 | 93.8% | 15× via distillation |
| **KD Student + INT8** | **55** | **92.19%** | **52× — winner** |

> **Key finding:** KD + INT8 = **52× compression, 5.5% accuracy loss.**
> PTQ alone causes 14% drop — Knowledge Distillation is essential for aggressive compression on small models.
> This is the same approach used in Tesla AI4 and Mobileye EyeQ (INT8 on-chip inference).

## 7. Model Deployment & On-Device Performance

### Deployment Steps

1. Export all models to TFLite INT8 via Ultralytics export with 100-image calibration set
2. Transfer `.tflite` files to Pi via `scp`
3. Install TFLite Runtime, picamera2, RPi.GPIO on Pi (no full TensorFlow needed)
4. Run: `python3 src/main.py --mode pi`

### On-Device Performance — Raspberry Pi 5, No Accelerator (Live Measured)

| Stage | Time |
|---|---|
| Frame capture (picamera2) | ~100 ms |
| COCO YOLOv8n INT8 | **55 ms** (FP32: 131 ms) |
| DriveIndia YOLOv8n INT8 | ~49 ms |
| Pothole YOLOv8n INT8 | ~122 ms |
| Fusion + GPIO + logging | ~1 ms |
| **Total 3-model ensemble** | **~227 ms → ~1.8 FPS** |

### Live Demo Features

- **MJPEG stream:** `live_server.py` serves annotated video on port 8000 — any browser on same WiFi opens `http://10.80.11.159:8000`
- **ThingsBoard telemetry:** pushes `latency_fp32_ms`, `latency_int8_ms`, `decision`, `distance_cm`, `classes` per frame
- **Edge vs cloud proof:** Cloud MQTT RTT ~280 ms vs edge pipeline ~175 ms — edge finishes before cloud even receives the frame

## 9. Conclusions & Limitations

### Key Outcomes

- **52× model compression** (KD+INT8, 55 KB, 92.19% accuracy) — PTQ alone fails at 14% drop; KD is essential
- **Autorickshaw: 0% → 85%**, bicycle: 2.7% → 97.5%, zebra crossing: 0% → 90.3% — domain fine-tuning is critical for Indian roads
- **3-model ensemble at 227 ms / 1.8 FPS** on Raspberry Pi 5 CPU, no accelerator, ₹12,000 total
- **Cloud-only ADAS disproved empirically:** cloud MQTT RTT ~280 ms vs airbag deadline 30 ms — not physically compatible
- **Vehicle-agnostic:** same hardware works on bicycle, autorickshaw, bus, or truck
- ThingsBoard confirmed **FP32 avg 131 ms vs INT8 avg 55 ms** — 2.4× measured speedup live

### Limitations

- HC-SR04 max range 4 m — limits to city/cycling speeds; TFmini-S LiDAR (12 m) needed for highway use
- LED/buzzer breadboard wiring has ground-rail voltage drop issue — code verified correct, hardware debug ongoing
- DriveIndia fine-tune on 5,000-image subset only; truck and bus recall dropped 12% due to fewer samples
- No adverse-condition testing (rain, night, fog)
- PTQ causes 14% accuracy drop on small MobileNetV2 — QAT or KD required for small-model production deployment

---

## 10. Future Work

- **Full DriveIndia training:** 66,986 images, 100+ epochs → expected mAP50 > 0.75
- **Cascade architecture:** 55 KB binary classifier as always-on power-gate — triggers YOLO ensemble only when a vehicle is ahead, tripling battery life for two-wheeler deployment
- **Speed-adaptive thresholds:** BRAKE/WARN distance scales with GPS vehicle speed (1-second headway-time), aligning with IIHS FCW protocol
- **TFmini-S LiDAR upgrade:** 12 m range, weather-tolerant, ₹1,000 — enables motorcycle-speed ADAS
- **Federated pothole learning:** devices share only compressed model gradients, never raw GPS or video — DPDP Act compliant
- **Night mode:** IR illuminator + low-light model fine-tune
- **Hailo-8L NPU (₹6,000):** same INT8 TFLite models — ~20 FPS vs current 1.8 FPS

## 11. Challenges & Mitigation

| Challenge | How We Addressed It |
|---|---|
| **Domain shift:** COCO blind to autorickshaws (0% recall) | Fine-tuned YOLOv8n on 5,000-image balanced DriveIndia subset → 85% recall |
| **Class imbalance in DriveIndia:** rare classes in <2% of frames | `subset_driveindia.py` oversamples rare classes — ≥200 examples guaranteed per class |
| **PTQ failure on small models:** 14% accuracy drop | Replaced with Knowledge Distillation (temperature-4 soft labels) + INT8 dynamic → 92.19% |
| **HC-SR04 ECHO pin at 5V on 3.3V Pi GPIO** | 1kΩ + 2kΩ voltage divider on ECHO line — without this the GPIO pin fails silently |
| **Ground-rail voltage drop across multiple sensors** | Dedicated GND wire from Pi pin 6 directly to breadboard rail |
| **67K dataset, limited Kaggle quota** | Balanced 5,000-image subset → 30 epochs in 27 min on T4 |
| **tfmot incompatibility with Keras 3** | `tensorflow-model-optimization` does not support Keras 3; used custom pruning loop |
| **ThingsBoard 401 auth error** | Token was not substituted at runtime — fixed by passing `--token` argument explicitly |
| **No road access for outdoor validation** | ThingsBoard MQTT + live MJPEG stream used for indoor functional verification |
