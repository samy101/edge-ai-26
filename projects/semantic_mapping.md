🌐 **[View Project Page →](https://rajneeshbabu.github.io/Edge-AI-Based-Hailo-Accelerated-Real-Time-2D-Semantic-Mapping-with-RPi5-for-Assistive-Navigation/)**

A real-time, on-device semantic navigation aid for the visually impaired using **Raspberry Pi 5 + Hailo-8 AI HAT** (13 TOPS NPU). A pruned, INT8-quantized YOLOv8n model detects 20 indoor-relevant object classes at **24.7 FPS** and fuses detections with gyroscope yaw from an Arduino Nicla Vision to build a live **2D polar semantic map** — fully offline, no cloud, no GPU required.

##  Highlights

---

- **True edge deployment** — everything runs on RPi5 + Hailo-8; no cloud, no GPU, no internet required at runtime
- **5-stage compression pipeline** — FP32 → PTQ → QAT → L1 Structured Pruning → Hailo HEF; pruned model achieves **+9.4% mAP50** over the FP32 baseline
- **1.87× faster** inference after pruning, at only **4.5 MB** model size (HEF)
- **Sensor fusion** — IMU yaw from Nicla Vision combined with bounding-box geometry to compute real-world object heading and distance every frame
- **Live dual-window display** — Window 1: detection feed with labeled bounding boxes; Window 2: top-down 2D polar map with range rings at 1 m intervals

##  Problem Statement

---

Visually impaired individuals navigate indoor environments with limited situational awareness. Existing assistive technologies — white canes, GPS-based devices — either lack real-time object-level perception or require connectivity. Recent edge AI hardware now makes it possible to run deep-learning perception pipelines on compact, battery-powered computers at interactive frame rates, at a fraction of the cost of specialized robotic platforms.

The challenge is threefold:
1. **Model compression**: shrinking a capable detector to fit within the tight memory and compute budget of a consumer NPU
2. **NPU deployment**: handling the non-standard multi-head output of YOLOv8 on a proprietary accelerator (Hailo-8) that requires its own compilation toolchain
3. **Sensor fusion**: combining per-frame camera detections with continuous IMU yaw to maintain a persistent spatial model of nearby objects

##  Project Objectives

---

- Train and compress a YOLOv8n model for 20 indoor-relevant COCO classes using a reproducible Colab pipeline
- Compile the model to Hailo Executable Format (HEF) using the Hailo Dataflow Compiler (DFC)
- Deploy on Raspberry Pi 5 + Hailo-8 AI HAT at real-time frame rates
- Fuse detections with gyroscope yaw from a Nicla Vision IMU to estimate each object's world heading and distance
- Display results as a live detection feed and a 2D top-down polar semantic map

##  Dataset

---

We used **COCO128** (a 128-image subset of MS-COCO) for training, fine-tuning, and INT8 calibration. Only the **20 VI-relevant classes** out of COCO's 80 were used; all others were discarded.

**Selected classes (COCO IDs):**

| person (0) | backpack (24) | handbag (26) | suitcase (28) | bottle (39) | cup (41) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| fork (42) | knife (43) | spoon (44) | bowl (45) | chair (56) | couch (57) |
| bed (59) | dining table (60) | laptop (63) | mouse (64) | remote (65) | keyboard (66) |
| cell phone (67) | book (73) | | | | |

**Why these classes?** Objects likely encountered in indoor home and office environments — furniture, tableware, personal items, and electronics — were retained. Outdoor and non-navigational classes (vehicles, animals, sports equipment) were excluded.

**Dataset link:** [COCO128 on Ultralytics HUB](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/coco128.zip) — auto-downloaded when running the notebook.

##  Model: YOLOv8n

---

We start from the publicly pretrained **YOLOv8n** (nano) checkpoint and fine-tune it on our 20-class subset. YOLOv8 uses an **anchor-free Detect head** with **Distribution Focal Loss (DFL)** for bounding-box regression — which requires special handling on the Hailo NPU (see [Deployment](#-deployment-on-rpi5--hailo-8)).

**Architecture overview:**
- Backbone: YOLOv8n CSPDarknet (lightweight)
- Neck: PANet feature pyramid
- Head: Anchor-free Detect → 3 scales (strides 8, 16, 32) → 6 raw output tensors

**Why YOLOv8n?** Smallest YOLO variant, designed for edge deployment. Its DFL head is more accurate than anchor-based heads at small model sizes.

##  Training & Optimization Pipeline

---

All training runs on **Google Colab T4 GPU**. The full notebook is in [`Colab Development flow/EDGE_SLAM.ipynb`](Colab%20Development%20flow/EDGE_SLAM.ipynb). The pipeline has 5 stages:

### Stage 1 — FP32 Baseline Fine-Tuning

Fine-tune pretrained YOLOv8n for 20 epochs on COCO128, restricted to 20 target classes.

```python
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')
model.train(data='coco128.yaml', epochs=20, imgsz=640,
            batch=16, device=0, classes=TARGET_CLASS_IDS)
```

**Result:** mAP50 = 0.6269 | latency = 8.30 ms | size = 6.23 MB

### Stage 2 — Post-Training Quantization (PTQ, TensorRT INT8)

Converts FP32 weights to INT8 using 64 COCO128 calibration images — no retraining.

**Result:** mAP50 = 0.6093 (−2.8%) | latency = 4.66 ms | 1.78× faster

### Stage 3 — Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)

Retrains with simulated INT8 quantization noise injected during forward pass for 20 epochs.

**Result:** mAP50 = 0.5944 (−5.2%) — COCO128 is too small for QAT to be effective; full COCO would be needed.

### Stage 4 — L1 Structured Pruning + Fine-Tuning  **(Deployed)**

Removes 20% of Conv2d filters ranked lowest by L1-norm. Unlike unstructured sparsity, filter removal produces a genuinely smaller dense model. Fine-tuned for 20 more epochs after pruning.

```python
for name, module in model.named_modules():
    if isinstance(module, torch.nn.Conv2d):
        prune.l1_unstructured(module, name='weight', amount=0.2)
        prune.remove(module, 'weight')
```

**Result:** mAP50 = **0.6793** (+8.4% over PTQ, +5.24% over baseline) | latency = 4.58 ms

> Removing noisy low-magnitude filters before quantization acts as implicit regularization — this is why pruning *improves* mAP rather than hurting it.

### Stage 5 — Knowledge Distillation (Ablation Only)

YOLOv8s teacher generates pseudo-labels; pruned YOLOv8n student trains on them. Not deployed.

**Result:** mAP50 = 0.5904 (−4.86%) — KD needs the full COCO dataset to be effective.

### Pipeline Summary

| Stage | mAP50 | FPS (T4) | Latency (ms) | Size (MB) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline FP32 | 0.6269 | 120.5 | 8.30 | 6.23 |
| PTQ INT8 | 0.6093 | 214.4 | 4.66 | 5.57 |
| QAT INT8 | 0.5944 | 186.6 | 5.36 | 5.65 |
| **Pruned INT8 (deployed)** | **0.6793** | **218.3** | **4.58** | 5.65 |
| KD INT8 (ablation) | 0.5904 | 120.5 | 8.30 | 6.23 |
| **Hailo HEF on RPi5** | — | **24.7** | 40.5 | **4.50** |

##  Deployment on RPi5 + Hailo-8

---

### Hailo HEF Compilation (Colab Phase B)

The pruned model is exported to **ONNX opset-11** (opset-13 uses operators unsupported by DFC) and compiled via:

```
ONNX (opset-11) → HAR → HAR (INT8 calibrated) → HEF (4.5 MB)
```

> **Note:** HEF compilation requires Python 3.10 + Hailo DFC wheel (~488 MB, must be downloaded from hailo.ai). It is run in a **separate Colab session** after restarting the runtime. See [`Colab Development flow/README.md`](Colab%20Development%20flow/README.md) for the full walkthrough.

### DFL Decoding on RPi5 CPU

Hailo exports 6 raw tensors (3 box + 3 class). DFL decoding runs on the RPi5 CPU after every inference call:

```python
# For each of 3 feature-map scales (stride s ∈ {8, 16, 32})
box_dist = (softmax(box_raw.reshape(H,W,4,16), axis=-1) * bins).sum(-1)
x1 = (cx + 0.5)*s - box_dist[...,0]*s
x2 = (cx + 0.5)*s + box_dist[...,2]*s
scores = sigmoid(cls_raw)
# → class-wise NMS (conf > 0.40, IoU < 0.45)
```

### Nicla Vision IMU Streaming

Nicla Vision (MicroPython, OpenMV IDE) calibrates gyro bias over 300 samples (~3 s), applies a dead-band filter (±0.8°/s), and streams yaw angle continuously:

```
A:156.68   ← format: A:<angle_degrees>
```

The RPi5 reads from `/dev/ttyACM0` in a background thread.

### 2D Semantic Map

Each detected object is placed on a polar map using:

1. **Camera FOV angle:** `α_offset = ((cx − W/2) / (W/2)) × 30°`
2. **Absolute heading:** `α_abs = (ψ_IMU + α_offset) mod 360°`
3. **Distance estimate:** `d = max(0.3 m, h_ref / h_bbox)` — reference height per class at 1 m
4. **EMA smoothing** (λ = 0.7) reduces per-frame jitter

Objects not seen for > 10 s are pruned. The 520×520 px OpenCV canvas shows range rings at 1 m intervals; dots are orange (< 2.5 m) or green (≥ 2.5 m).

##  Demo

##  Step-by-Step Reproduction Guide

---

### Step 1 — Nicla Vision Setup

> Full guide: [`Arduino Nicla Vision IMU/README.md`](Arduino%20Nicla%20Vision%20IMU/README.md)

1. Install **OpenMV IDE** from [openmv.io](https://openmv.io/pages/download)
2. Connect Nicla Vision to laptop via micro-USB → copy `Arduino Nicla Vision IMU/main_Nicla.py` to its internal disk → rename to `main.py`
3. Open in OpenMV IDE → Connect → Run → verify `A:<angle>` lines appear in serial monitor
4. Disconnect from laptop → plug into RPi5 USB port
5. **Hold the RPi5 still and vertical for 3 seconds after power-on** (gyro bias calibration)

### Step 2 — Colab Phase A (Training & ONNX Export)

> Full guide: [`Colab Development flow/README.md`](Colab%20Development%20flow/README.md)

1. Open `Colab Development flow/EDGE_SLAM.ipynb` in Google Colab (T4 GPU runtime)
2. Mount Google Drive — outputs save to `My Drive/edge_ai_project/`
3. **Run all cells EXCEPT the last cell**
   - Covers: baseline → PTQ → QAT → L1 pruning → KD ablation → ONNX export
   - The pruned ONNX model (`best_opset11.onnx`) is saved to Google Drive
4. **Do NOT run the last cell yet**

### Step 3 — Colab Phase B (HEF Compilation)

> Full guide: [`Colab Development flow/README.md`](Colab%20Development%20flow/README.md)

> The Hailo DFC requires Python 3.10 and is incompatible with Colab's default environment and Blackwell CUDA libraries — a fresh session is mandatory.

1. Go to [hailo.ai](https://hailo.ai) → create a free account → log in
2. Navigate: **Downloads → AI Accelerator → AI Suite → Dataflow Compiler → Linux → x86 → Python 3.10**
3. Download `hailo_dataflow_compiler-3.33.1-py3-none-linux_x86_64.whl` (~488 MB)
4. Upload the `.whl` to `My Drive/edge_ai_project/`
5. **Restart the Colab session** → run **only the last cell**
6. Grant Drive mount permission → the cell creates a Python 3.10 venv, installs DFC, and runs: Parse → Optimize (INT8, 64 calibration images, CPU-only) → Compile
7. Download the output `yolov8n_pruned.hef` (4.5 MB) to your laptop

### Step 4 — RPi5 One-Time Setup

> Full guide: [`RPI-Rpi5 deployment/README.md`](RPI-Rpi5%20deployment/README.md)

Connect via SSH (same Wi-Fi) or direct terminal:

```bash
# System packages
sudo apt install -y python3-venv python3-numpy python3-opencv \
  python3-serial python3-picamera2 v4l-utils rpicam-apps

# Hailo runtime
sudo apt install -y hailo-all

# Virtual environment
mkdir -p ~/edge_nav/models ~/edge_nav/logs
cd ~/edge_nav
python3 -m venv venv_edge_nav --system-site-packages
source ~/edge_nav/venv_edge_nav/bin/activate
pip install pyserial pyttsx3

# Verify
python -c "from hailo_platform import HEF, VDevice; print('Hailo OK')"
hailortcli fw-control identify
```

### Step 5 — Transfer Files to RPi5

> Full guide: [`RPI-Rpi5 deployment/README.md`](RPI-Rpi5%20deployment/README.md)

Run in **Windows PowerShell** (replace `<RPI_IP>` with the RPi5's Wi-Fi IP):

```powershell
scp "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\yolov8n_pruned.hef" `
    rpi15@<RPI_IP>:/home/rpi15/edge_nav/models/yolov8n_pruned.hef

scp "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\main_RPI.py" `
    rpi15@<RPI_IP>:/home/rpi15/edge_nav/main.py
```

### Step 6 — Run the System

> Full guide: [`RPI-Rpi5 deployment/README.md`](RPI-Rpi5%20deployment/README.md)

```bash
cd ~/edge_nav
source ~/edge_nav/venv_edge_nav/bin/activate
export DISPLAY=:0
python main.py
```

Two OpenCV windows open on the RPi5 display. Press **`q`** to quit.

##  Results & Analysis

---

### Model Optimization Results

The L1-pruned INT8 model is the Pareto-optimal point across all metrics:

- **mAP50 = 0.6793** — highest of all compression stages, +8.4% over PTQ and +5.24% over the FP32 baseline
- **Latency = 4.58 ms** on T4 GPU — 1.81× faster than FP32
- **Size = 5.65 MB** (ONNX) → **4.5 MB** after Hailo HEF compilation

The pruning improvement is counterintuitive: removing 20% of filters with the lowest L1 norms eliminates the filters that contributed the most noise during quantization, giving the quantizer cleaner weight distributions to round. This acts as a form of quantization-friendly regularization.

### On-Device Performance (RPi5 + Hailo-8)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Inference FPS | 24.7 FPS |
| HEF compilation time (Colab CPU) | ~8 minutes |
| Hailo-8 clusters used | 8 / 8 |
| Power draw (full system) | ~7–10 W (USB-C power bank) |
| IMU yaw latency | <20 ms (50 Hz polling) |

### Limitations

- **Distance estimation accuracy**: The reference-height heuristic assumes objects are upright and at a fixed aspect ratio; cluttered scenes with partial occlusions reduce accuracy
- **Gyro drift**: Integrating yaw from a MEMS gyroscope introduces slow drift over long sessions (~1–2°/minute); a magnetometer or visual odometry would correct this
- **COCO128 dataset**: 128 images is too small for QAT and KD to generalize; these stages would outperform PTQ on the full 118K-image COCO dataset
- **Indoor-only**: The 20 selected classes are optimised for indoor navigation; outdoor deployment would require retraining

##  Planned Improvements

---

- Replace the reference-height distance heuristic with a **lightweight monocular depth estimator** (e.g., MiDaS-small) for more accurate distance
- Add **visual odometry** for drift-free position tracking over long sessions (the gyroscope-only yaw drifts gradually)
- Extend to a **3D voxel semantic map** using depth + IMU fusion
- Detect more classes beyond the 20 currently used
- Port to a wearable form factor (e.g., glasses or vest-mounted)
- Run QAT and KD on the full COCO dataset for a fair comparison
